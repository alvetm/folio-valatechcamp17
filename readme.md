About
=====
These exercise files were created for the participants of the VALA Tech Camp 2017 held on 12th July 2017 in Melbourne Australia. Details on how to run these files can be found in the VALATechCamp17_Folio_program.docx
At the time of the event user-mod portion of the curriculum was dated due code being released often so the okapi and mod-user git repos were copied into the folio-tutorial-working-files to avoid git cloning.


Why
======
The exercise files are designed to expedite learning the curriculum as participants simply have to follow the program guide and execute the commands by typing in ./sh<#> then tab.
This significantly reduces the time required to complete the curriculum as steps to copy, paste, fix, execute, repeat are removed.
